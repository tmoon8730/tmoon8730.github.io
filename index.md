# Side Projects
Since I was around 11 or 12 years old I have been interested in programming and software development. The best way to learn a new programming language or technique is to do a few tutorials or build a side project with that language or technology. Over the years many I have built many side projects and most of them consisted of following tutorials. Listed below are the details for a few of the bigger and more interesting projects that I have completed.

## MEIRLBOT
- Source Code: [GitHub](https://github.com/tmoon8730/meirlbot.git)
- Description: The MEIRLBOT is a set of Java Spring Boot applications for the purpose of creating and displaying memes. The main reason for creating this project was to learn new technologies and build resumes.
- Technical Spec: Java Spring Boot Application
- Code Example:

``` java
@SpringBootApplication
public class MemeExchangeApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(MemeExchangeApplication.class, args);
  }
}
```

    let newDrive = DriveEntity(entity: entityDrive!, insertIntoManagedObjectContext: managedContext)
    newDrive.quarter = quarter
    newDrive.time = time
    newDrive.yardLine = yardLine
    do{
        try newDrive.managedObjectContext?.save()
        print("New drive added: \(newDrive.quarter!) with \(newDrive.time!) left on the \(newDrive.yardLine!) yard line")
        return true
    }catch{
        let saveError = error as NSError
        print(saveError)
    }
    return false
}
