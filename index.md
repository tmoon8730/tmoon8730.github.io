# Side Projects
Since I was around 11 or 12 years old I have been interested in programming and software development. The best way to learn a new programming language or technique is to do a few tutorials or build a side project with that language or technology. Over the years many I have built many side projects and most of them consisted of following tutorials. Listed below are the details for a few of the bigger and more interesting projects that I have completed.

## MEIRLBOT
- Source Code: [GitHub](https://github.com/tmoon8730/meirlbot.git)
- Description: The MEIRLBOT is a set of Java Spring Boot applications for the purpose of creating and displaying memes. The main reason for creating this project was to learn new technologies and build resumes.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
